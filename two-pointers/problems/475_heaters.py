# Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

# Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range. 

# Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.

# Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

    def findRadius(self, houses: List[int], heaters: List[int]) -> int:
        res = a = 0
        heaters.sort()
        while a < len(houses):
            b = 0
            dist = abs(houses[a] - heaters[b])
            while b < len(heaters) - 1 and abs(houses[a] - heaters[b + 1]) <= dist:
                b += 1
                dist = abs(heaters[b] - houses[a])
                
            res = max(res, dist)
            a += 1
        return res
