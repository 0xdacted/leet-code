# Given a callable function f(x, y) with a hidden formula and a value z, reverse engineer the formula and return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z. 
# You may return the pairs in any order.

# While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:

# f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
# f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)
