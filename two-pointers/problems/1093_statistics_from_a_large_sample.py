# You are given a large sample of integers in the range [0, 255]. Since the sample is so large, it is represented by an array count where count[k] is the number of times that k appears in the sample.

# Calculate the following statistics:
# minimum: The minimum element in the sample.
# maximum: The maximum element in the sample.
# mean: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
# median:
  # If the sample has an odd number of elements, then the median is the middle element once the sample is sorted.
  # If the sample has an even number of elements, then the median is the average of the two middle elements once the sample is sorted.
# mode: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be unique.

# Return the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point numbers [minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
