# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

# Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

# Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        i = 1
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                nums.pop(i)
            else:
                i += 1
