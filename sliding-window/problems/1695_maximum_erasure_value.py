# You are given an array of positive integers nums and want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. 
# The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements.
# Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.
# An array b is called to be a subarray of a if it forms a contiguous subsequence of a, that is, if it is equal to a[l],a[l+1],...,a[r] for some (l,r).
