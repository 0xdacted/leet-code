# The k-beauty of an integer num is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:
# It has a length of k.
# It is a divisor of num.
# Given integers num and k, return the k-beauty of num.
# Note:
#Leading zeros are allowed.
# 0 is not a divisor of any value.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
