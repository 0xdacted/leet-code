# A string is considered beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:
# Each of the 5 English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') must appear at least once in it.
# The letters must be sorted in alphabetical order 
# (i.e. all 'a's before 'e's, all 'e's before 'i's, etc.).

# For example, strings "aeiou" and "aaaaaaeiiiioou" are considered beautiful, 
# but "uaeio", "aeoiu", and "aaaeeeooo" are not beautiful.

# Given a string word consisting of English vowels, return the length of the longest beautiful substring of word. 
# If no such substring exists, return 0.

# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
