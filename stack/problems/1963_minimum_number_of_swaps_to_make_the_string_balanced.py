# You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

# A string is called balanced if and only if:
# It is the empty string, or
# It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
# It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.

# You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

# Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.
