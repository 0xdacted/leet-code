# You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

# Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        letter = set(letters)
        for i in range(ord(target) + 1, ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(i) in letter:
                return chr(i)
        return letters[0]

class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        idx = bisect_right(letters, target)
        if idx < len(letters):
            return letters[idx]
        else:
            return letters[0]
